# FirstProject

Ok I will add checkpoints here :
about what all I have learnt -
till now -

1. Angular setup and structure
2. Angular Components and how standalone were introduced
3. components in angular are built using  cli.
4. data-binding 1-way, 2-way and signal.
5. started learning about ng-if and ng-for , something I didn't realise
before is how powerful ngmodel and two way data binding is.
6. also learnt about attribute -derivatives.pretty cool things in angular. the only thing that disappoints that it is really verbose and can get really complex.
7. ok it seems that I found the first major con of angular @if,@else why do I have to write it like this. React in this regards is so much better with its jsx elements.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
