// copilot tell me about what this file does and how does it test the component
// This file is a test suite that tests the StructuralDirectiveComponent component. It uses the TestBed.configureTestingModule() method to configure the testing module. The component is then created using the TestBed.createComponent() method. The test checks if the component is created successfully by calling the expect() method with the component as an argument. If the component is created successfully, the test passes.  
// do I add my own test cases to this file?
// is it necessary to add test cases to this file?

// what are the common mistakes to avoid while writing test cases for Angular components?
//copilot answer the above questions 
// Yes, you can add your own test cases to this file. It is necessary to add test cases to ensure that your component behaves as expected. Some best practices for writing test cases for Angular components include:
// - Writing descriptive test names
// - Testing both positive and negative scenarios
// - Keeping tests independent and isolated
// - Using beforeEach() and afterEach() hooks to set up and tear down test data
// - Using spies to mock dependencies
// - Using async() and fakeAsync() for asynchronous tests
// Some common mistakes to avoid while writing test cases for Angular components include:
// - Not testing all code paths
// - Not testing edge cases
// - Not testing error handling
// ok got it good.
